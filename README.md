# DORK
## It's like Zork for your UX
Wait, what? No really, it's your user journey as a text adventure.
## The Story So Far
I was speccing out a big project for a client and noticed that a UX user journey reads very much like a really dull text adventure. I thought to myself "Does this have to be dull?". Yes. You're writing software. Get over it. It doesn't mean it also can't be boring, useful, AND dumb. That's why I started Dork.
